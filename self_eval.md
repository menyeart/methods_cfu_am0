# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
>>I feel pretty confident about the basic methods but sometimes get confused with the ones that take multiple optional parameters. It seems like it really comes down to finding a website that can explain it in the best way for me.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
>> I feel pretty confident in writing simple methods though sometimes I forget that defining them doesnt necessarily print anything or that they should only do one thing.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
>> Can any kind of data type or be passed to a method? How many arguments can be passed to a method?
